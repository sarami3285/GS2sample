Game Server Services(GS2) is a back-end server service (BaaS) specialized for game development.

GS2 is a general-purpose game server solution created to improve efficiency for game developers and supports Games as a Service (GaaS) and Live Gaming.

The service allows for flexible management of player data and data analysis, enabling proper analysis of in-game resource distribution and consumption to maintain a healthy environment.
